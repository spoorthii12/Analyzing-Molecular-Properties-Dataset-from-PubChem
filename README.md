# Analyzing-Molecular-Properties-Dataset-from-PubChem
This assignment is designed to evaluate your ability to work with real-world chemical data and apply data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. You will be working with molecular property data obtained from PubChem.


Assignment Steps

1.Load the dataset into a Jupyter notebook using Pandas

2.Inspect the data: Check column names, data types, and handle any missing values.

3. Perform basic data cleaning if needed.

4. Visualize at least 2 property trends, such as:

Molecular Weight vs LogP
Any other relevant combination (e.g., LogP vs compound name)
5. Add clear labels and titles to your plots.
6. Bonus (Optional): Explain how trends in these molecular properties can support solvent selection in drug development.
